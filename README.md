# Oluborode Onaopemipo

I'm Onaopemipo from Nigeria. I am aspiring to become a full stack developer. Right now, I have strong knowledge of Backend technologies, and I am using python or javascript and Bootstrap CSS for web page designs and development. Also, I have experience in Microsoft Cloud services, including Office 365 and Endpoint Management. For 2022, I look to learn MERN stack to bolster my software development skills.
